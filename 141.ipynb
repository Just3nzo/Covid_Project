        "- Practice identifying opportunities for data analysis.\n",
        "- Practice performing EDA.\n",
        "- Practice working with data from Kaggle.\n",
        "- Practice visualizing data with Matplotlib & Seaborn.\n",
        "- Practice reading data, performing queries, and filtering data using Pandas.\n",

        "You, as the lead data scientist of your country **have to create and prove a plan of fighting the pandemics in your country** by analyzing the provided data.\n",

        "- Perform data cleaning and feature engineering. Work with features - handle missing data if needed, use Pandas date APIs, create other additional features. Done\n",
        "- Perform exploratory data analysis. Describe the data with basic statistical parameters - mean, median, quantiles, etc. Use parameters that give you the most important statistical insights of the data. Grouping the data and analyzing the groups - using Pandas aggregate methods. Visualize the data - you can use line, scatter, histogram plots, density plots, regplots, etc.\n",
        "- Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results did you get, and what these results mean.\n",
        "- Present the project - the data, methods, and results.\n",
        "- Provide suggestions about how your analysis can be improved.\n",

        "As a data scientists you will spend significant amount of your time learning new things.\n",

        "It is very important to gradually build this skill - it is extremely valuable for all data scientists.\n",

        "- Try dimensionality reduction algorithm (e.g. PCA, t-SNE, Autoencoder).\n",
        "- Try clustering your data.\n",

        "- Try to use a statistical significance test.\n",
